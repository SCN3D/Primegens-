 <p><strong>Primer Design covering CpG Island</strong><br/></p>

<p>Primer design covering CpG IslandÂ” is one of the unique features of PRIMEGENS-v2, which can be used to
study methylation patterns of various oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This feature designs primers for genes that have CpG islands present in close proximity to their respective TSSs. Primers can be designed
to amplify genes whose expressions are suspected to be influenced by nearby CpG islands. In this approach,
locating CpG islands is determined by a PRIMEGENS-v2 variable, VICINITY. PRIMEGENS-v2 looks for
the presence of CpG islands in the region of VICINITY, in both sides of a genes TSS. It tries to cover either
the whole or partial CpG islands in the region of the VICINITY value. CpG islands can lie to the left,
right, or across the TSS. In addition, users can also provide their direction or region of interest to enable
PRIMEGENS-v2 to look for CpG islands. By default, CpG islands present in any of the three possible
positions are considered, and the distance between a CpG island and TSS, if found at one or the other side
of TSS are also reported. Based on this information, PRIMEGENS-v2 extracts the final query sequence
for the primer design. The length of the query sequence to be used for primer design is also determined
by PRIMEGENS-v2 variables QLENGTH and MINCOVER (see Section 5.2.2). The FSPD algorithm is
recommended for this type of primer design due to the long length of CpG islands. Figure 10 shows this
feature of PRIMEGENS-v2, illustrates a design primer for genes surrounded by CpG islands. Thus far, this
feature has been used and supported for human genome and their TSS and CpG locations. Other supported
genomes will be used and tested in the future.

                     <p align="center">Amplified CpG islands within the vicinity of a genes TSS. (A) shows the presence of
CpG island at the left side of the TSS (gradient blue) lying inside the region of VICINITY. Here,
the query sequence has been picked of the length of QLENGTH value covering the MINCOVER
region at the opposite side of the TSS (right side), the TSS itself, and portion of the CpG on
the left. (B) shows the presence of CpG island across the TSS (gradient blue). Here, the query
sequence has been picked of the length of QLENGTH value equally covering both sides of the
TSS. (C) shows the presence of CpG island at the right side of the TSS (gradient blue) with its
start position lying inside the region of VICINITY at the right side of the TSS. Here, the query
sequence has been picked of the length of QLENGTH value covering the MINCOVER region at
the opposite side of the TSS (left side), the TSS itself, and portion of CpG at the left. </p>
